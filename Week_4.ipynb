Introduction</h1>\n<br>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods. Often times, people come across situations which forces them to move to a different city or even a different country, or maybe they do so of their own free will. But in any case it is important that the neighborhood we choose to live in is as close as possible to the neighborhood we want it to be. i.e. our new neighborhood should be similar to our old one as much as possible. It allows us to adapt more easily as well as the places we like will be in close proximity.</p>\n\n<h3>Why we need a better solution?</h3>\n<p>If we try to do it manually it will require us to check each and every neighborhood, find whether hundreds of venues such as restaurants, exist in close proximity or not. What is the distance from the schools, hospitals and many more factors? Doing this will require a lot of man-hours, and it still might not be effective enough. Thus, using a machine learning algorithm is a much better option. This Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both fresh and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.</p>\n\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p>To accomplish this project I have used K-Means Classification. The user will provide the neighborhood location where he/she used to live, and the model will predict which neighborhoods are the most similar to their last neighborhood along with a Similarity Score.</p>\n\n<h3>Target Audience</h3>\n<p>This model can be used by real estate agencies to provide customers with the best housing options in the city of Toronto.</p>\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h1>2.

In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighborhood\n2. Neighborhood Latitude\n3. Neighborhood Longitude\n4. Venue\n5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n6. Venue Latitude\n7. Venue Longitude\n8.
